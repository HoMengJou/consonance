# Consonance: Aesthetic responses to microtonal intervals
These codes are for plotting results of a pilot consonance perceptual experiment conducted in CompMusic Lab, SFC, Keio University, Japan.

Plot types including:
1) Line graph (for visualizing raw data),
2) Scatter plot (for correaltion), and
3) Violin plot (for comparisons by interval types).

All variations of diagrams are listed for violin plot, but only one example for each comparison is shown for scatter plot and line graph. Full names of the abbreviations used in the csv file is listed at the end of each R file and shown below:
